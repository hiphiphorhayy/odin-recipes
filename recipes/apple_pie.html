        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Dough for double-crust pie</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1/3 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>6 to 7 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1 large egg white</li>
            <li>Optional: Turbinado or coarse sugar, ground cinnamon, vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2><em>Directions</em></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°. On a lightly floured surface, roll half the dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle; transfer to a 9-in. pie plate. Chill while preparing filling. In a small bowl, combine sugars, flour and spices. In a large bowl, toss apples with lemon juice. Add sugar mixture; toss to coat. Add filling to crust; dot with butter.</li>
            <li>Roll remaining dough to a 1/8-in.-thick circle. Place over filling. Trim, seal and flute edge. Cut slits in top. Beat egg white until foamy; brush over crust. If desired, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and ground cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Bake on the lowest rack 60-70 minutes, until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly, covering with foil halfway if crust begins to get too dark. Cool on a wire rack. If desired, serve with ice cream and caramel sauce.</li>
        </ol>
